## 📚 What is EduTrade?  
Welcome to **EduTrade**, the ultimate platform where senior students can *trade* their study materials—like quizzes, assignments, and exam notes—with peers, while earning some cash on the side! 💸 Built for students, by students, EduTrade lets sellers set their price, upload materials, and share knowledge, while buyers can easily find the resources they need with smart filters. We take a small 10% platform fee (e.g., $0.50 on a $5 sale), and the rest goes straight to the seller. Powered by Go, React, MongoDB, and Docker, EduTrade is your go-to hub for educational trading—secure, fast, and student-friendly. Ready to trade smart and learn easy? Let’s get started! 🎓
